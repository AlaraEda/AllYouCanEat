# AllYouCanEat

```
Just so yall know;

I'm on a seafood diet.

             I see food...
            ... and I eat it.
```

### First of all
I have made this game in Phaser by using Javascript. 
First I made this game in Phaser's very own sandbox, which you can find [here](http://phaser.io/sandbox/edit/nhffkysH). I later on decided to also put my code here on GitHub so that I can share it with others. 

### Intro
You are an outerspace alien who has never heard of human food. 
So naturally, you're going out to investigate by jumping from one block to the another, minding the dangerous waters ofcourse. 
But beware, jump on a few too many wrong blocks and you might cage yourself in. 

### Game Explained
The goal of this game is to get points by eating as much food as you can, preferably the Melon.<br>
Each food gives the player a different set of points:

```
  Melon:     +50
  Pineaplle: +30
  Mushroom:  +10
  Pepper:    -100
```
**There will be times where you have to make a strategic choice:** <br>
Will you grab the Pepper? <br>
Fully knowing you will lose points, but also knowing that you might be able to make up for it later?<br>
Or will you chance the big jump all the way to the Melon? Knowing you will put yourself in a bad-position if you make it.<br>
```
                                           The choice is up to you.
```
*But beware of the dangerous waters and ofcourse the time...*

### What does the game consist of?
This game consists of some of the factors of "The 8 Core Principles" of gameing.
```
     Loss & Avoidance:          The player loses points when he/she grabs a hold of the pepper.
     
     Scarcity & Impatience:     The game consists of only one melon.
     
     Unpredictability:          The player has no idea where the next block in the game will appear.
     
     Empowerment of Creativity: The aim of the game is to design your own path of blocks. 
                                While also making the deleberate choice of grabbing good or bad food
                                so you can continue on to the next level.
     
```
  
The game also consist of the "Game Components": Points, leveling up and progression. <br>
In terms of "Meaningfull Play" you can "level up" and get Audio & Visual feedback while playing the game.<br>
Out of the "8 kinds of fun" this game is the submission type. <br>

**This game complies to the term "Gameplay" since it consists of:**
* A goal
* Rules
* And choices.
